_"Wait, you paid what for that apartment the size of a post stamp?!"_ is for some a commenly heard phrase. But what does that all really mean? Square meters and and square meter prices can be too abstract in many cases. So what if we chance things around and look at what you really get for your hard-earned money? 

And since we all had a bitterball, stroopwafel, or tompouce at least once in our lifes it might be a good idea to relate it to those items.
